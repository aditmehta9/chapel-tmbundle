Chapel.tmbundle
---------------

This is a Textmate bundle that will eventually contain a set of tools for doing Chapel development in Textmate. For now it only supports simple syntax highlighting, but more advanced tools will come.

Chapel is a new parallel programming language being developed by Cray Inc. as part of the DARPA-led High Productivity Computing Systems program (HPCS). Chapel is designed to improve the productivity of high-end computer users while also serving as a portable parallel programming model that can be used on commodity clusters or desktop multicore systems. Chapel strives to vastly improve the programmability of large-scale parallel computers while matching or beating the performance and portability of current programming models like MPI.

The original author of this Textmate bundle is [bholt][0]. The Chapel team maintains the keywords and very basic syntax in order to support syntax highlighting on Github. The bundle itself is not tested or used with Textmate, as far as we know.
