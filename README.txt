Chapel.tmbundle
---------------

This is a Textmate bundle that will eventually contain a set of tools for doing Chapel development in Textmate. For now it only supports simple syntax highlighting, but more advanced tools will come.

Chapel is a new parallel programming language being developed by Cray Inc. as part of the DARPA-led High Productivity Computing Systems program (HPCS). Chapel is designed to improve the productivity of high-end computer users while also serving as a portable parallel programming model that can be used on commodity clusters or desktop multicore systems. Chapel strives to vastly improve the programmability of large-scale parallel computers while matching or beating the performance and portability of current programming models like MPI.
